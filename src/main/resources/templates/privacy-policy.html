    <!-- Privacy Policy Content -->
    <div class="text-left">
        <p class="mb-6">Welcome to Apps Studio Work. Our applications and services are generally intended for adults and designed primarily with adults in mind. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all our users by implementing a strict no-data-collection policy.

        <p class="mb-3">This means:</p>

        </ul>

        <p class="mb-6">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage users to review our Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">No Data Collection Notice</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">Unlike many websites and applications, we do not collect any user information. This includes:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6">
            <li class="mb-2">No collection of browser information</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">Privacy Regulation Compliance</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Our no-data collection approach ensures compliance with various privacy regulations worldwide, including:</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">The GDPR is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union. Since we do not collect, process, or store any personal data, we naturally comply with GDPR requirements. We do not need to establish a lawful basis for data processing, implement data subject rights mechanisms, or appoint a Data Protection Officer as we do not engage in any data processing activities covered by the GDPR.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">The CCPA gives California residents the right to know what personal information is collected about them, the right to delete this information, and the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. As we do not collect any personal information, California residents' rights under the CCPA are inherently protected.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">The CPRA amends and expands the CCPA, providing additional privacy protections for California residents. Since we do not collect, use, share, or sell any personal information, we are in compliance with the CPRA's enhanced requirements.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">VCDPA (Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act)</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">The VCDPA provides Virginia residents with rights regarding their personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, and opt out of the processing of their personal data for targeted advertising. Our no-data collection policy ensures compliance with the VCDPA as we do not process any personal data of Virginia residents.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act)</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">PIPEDA is Canada's federal privacy law for private-sector organizations. It sets out the ground rules for how businesses must handle personal information in the course of their commercial activities. As we do not collect, use, or disclose any personal information in our commercial activities, we comply with PIPEDA's requirements.</p>

        <p class="mb-6">Our commitment to not collecting any personal data means that users do not need to worry about how their data is being used, stored, or shared, as we simply do not engage in any of these activities.</p>
