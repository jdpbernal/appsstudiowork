        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">Last Updated: June 16, 2025</p>

        <p class="mb-6">Welcome to the Compass GeoLocation App by Apps Studio Work. This Privacy Policy is specific to our Compass GeoLocation Application and explains our approach to privacy, emphasizing our commitment to protecting your location data and personal information.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">About Our Compass GeoLocation App</h2>

            <li>Only accesses your location data to provide compass and location services</li>
            <li>Processes location data locally on your device</li>
            <li>Does not store your location history on our servers</li>
            <li>Does not share your location data with third parties</li>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Device Permissions</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Our Compass GeoLocation App requires only the minimum permissions necessary to function:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Location access: Required for providing accurate compass directions and location information</li>
            <li>Compass sensor access: Required for compass functionality</li>
            <li>Storage access (optional): Only if you choose to save location data locally on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-6">We do not request any other permissions that are not directly related to the core functionality of the app.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">The location data accessed by our app is used solely for providing compass and location services within the app. This data is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or shared with any third parties. If you choose to save location data, it is stored locally on your device and can be deleted at any time through the app's settings.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">While our Compass GeoLocation App is generally intended for adults, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age. Since our app processes location data locally and does not transmit it to our servers, children's privacy is inherently protected.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Our Compass GeoLocation App does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks. This means there is no sharing of information with external entities.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Security</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">We are committed to ensuring the security of our application. We regularly update our app to address any potential security vulnerabilities and to ensure that your location data remains secure and private.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage users to review our Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Privacy Regulation Compliance</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Our privacy-focused approach ensures compliance with various privacy regulations worldwide, including GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, VCDPA, and PIPEDA. Since we process location data locally on your device and do not transmit it to our servers, we naturally comply with these regulations' requirements.</p>
