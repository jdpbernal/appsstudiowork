        <p class="mb-6">Our Step Counter App is a fitness utility application that helps users track their daily steps, distance walked, and calories burned. The app is designed to be user-friendly and privacy-focused, collecting only the minimum data necessary to provide its core functionality.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">Information We Collect</h2>
